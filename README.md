Welcome to Season Break, an adorable platformer game created for the FCAI-CU GameJam, where you embark on a thrilling adventure as a cute monster! Your goal is to guide our lovable protagonist through 5 levels filled with captivating challenges and magical surprises. Change the seasons to modify the landscapes and navigate through various obstacles.

## Skills Learned

During the development of Season Break, I had the opportunity to strengthen my programming skills in C#. I implemented essential concepts such as using singletons for efficient data management and leveraged C# Events for seamless communication between game elements. Additionally, I designed a reliable Scene Loader Class to ensure smooth level transitions. Moreover, I dabbled in UI design, creating attractive main menus and engaging settings interfaces.
